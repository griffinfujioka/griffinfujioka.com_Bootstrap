            <p>I'm a student at Washington State University originally from Issaquah, Washington. In December 2013 I'll be graduating with a B.S. in Computer Science and minors in Math and MIS. After graduation I'm spending some time traveling Southeast Asia before joining a startup or small company in the Seattle area.</p>
            <br />
            <p>Aside from building software I like reading, fishing, snowboarding, watching movies, German cars, sports, nearly any music that hits my ears and the company of my border collie Belle.</p>
